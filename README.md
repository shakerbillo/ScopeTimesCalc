# ScopeTimesCalc
 A small program that reads an integer from the keyboard using Scanner to print out the times table for that number. The table runs from 1 to 12.   // this scope is to help understand scope is and how it works. // creating variables and class with the same name "x" is considered as bad practices, this is only to help understand scope
